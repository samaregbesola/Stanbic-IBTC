To the women  with whom we're journeying and navigating the terrains together, we will be our sisters keepers and propel one another on this journey, clearing the tables to accommodate us and if we don't get a seat at the table, we build our own furniture companies and empower one another.

The decision was made at a time , it wasn't easy but with the help of my Love , we continue..

This week, we will be discussing the importance of making Voluntary Contributions (VC) to your pension fund. Voluntary Contributions (VCs) are additional contributions that can be made alongside the mandatory contributions remitted by your employer to your Retirement Savings Account (RSA).
----------
Yes, we do understand that these are difficult times. But, guess what ‚Äì a Naira saved is a Naira earned. So, if you want to #HappenToLife without worries, this is for you! 
----------
To make additional contributions into your RSA account, all you need to do is speak with your employer to make the necessary deductions from your monthly salary. Yes, it‚Äôs that simple and seamless! 
---------
You should also note that Voluntary Contributions could be any amount of your choice, it could be as little as N1,000, as long it is from your legitimate income and not more than 1/3 of your monthly salary, in line with the Labour Act, 1990.
----------
You are eligible to withdraw only 50% of your VC as long as the contributions have been retained in the account for at least 2 years. Subsequent withdrawals will be made after 2 years from the last withdrawal date. That is, if your last withdrawal date was January 2017, your next withdrawal date would be anytime from February 2019.
----------

Our relationship was hard at first for several reasons. We got together on the heels of other relationships, plus there is a 5-year age difference between us, and we both wanted to be in control. We went through some heavy judgment from our community. We argued and fought passionately over so many things: money, sex, time together, career goals, etc. We didn't think we'd make it. There were many times when we'd sit together in sadness, crying over the thought that we might lose each other. There was so much love between us, but we had no clue how to deal with these issues. We felt stuck, miserable, and very angry. We made a decision to give our relationship just six more months (as a last resort), and if it didn't change, we would let go of each other. During this six-month period, we were each to be completely who we were. This meant not hiding or pretending or compromising our individual beliefs and desires. We also attended couples therapy on a weekly basis. During this last-resort period, we were afforded an opportunity to really 'see' each other for who we were versus who we thought the other was or how we wanted the other to be. It was a time to get real. We discovered that we were each doing backflips to show 'love' to the other in ways that wasn't meaningful to that person. That was a huge 'aha' moment! It meant that I got to stop bringing her flowers and instead would sit [with her] to forecast our budget. She learned that the act of paying the bills was not an intimate act for me and that I preferred time talking together. Our marriage is so beautiful now. We really know each other.

Thanks so much @stanbicibtc for this great opportunity .
Saving was really an easy thing for me while growing up , because I felt money will always come any how and anywhere, so I felt there was no need saving.
Thanks to My Treasure, who taught me on the importance of saving for rainy days. 
In our journey of love , my saving altitude has really improved and I have seen the good and importance of saving.
I won't forget in 2021, when my husband suggested we saved to buy a landed property by December 2021, I was actually complained because I knew my expenses will be reduced. All thanks to him who encouraged me and we started saving bit by bit. Honestly we got the money before December and bought the land, by February 2022, surrounded lands increased to almost two times the price we bought. Currently, people who have lands in that area are counted as big boys because the price is so high now.
I am so happy we saved and bought the land.
Indeed saving pays .

The other day, someone tweeted about akara sellers making up to 600k per month! Lool!
While this particular figure is likely an exaggeration, especially when you consider the many daily running costs, it is no secret that Nigerian women are deeply enterprising.
 
I would know! The sheer number of applicants for our enterprise challenge every year, whew!
 
But how can we help these women scale up their businesses in the current clime? How do you convince a road side business owner to take a loan that will be good for her business when the very process of taking the loan is keeping her from business?
 
Long processing hours, impossible collateral, excruciating interest rates and more. All these are barriers to getting proper business funding.
 
STANBIC IBTC has come to change that narrative for good.
 
Stanbic IBTC has made the process of application and collection simple and seamless whether you are a new customer or an existing customer, you can access as low as N50,000 or as high as N10,000,000 to support your working capital and meet up with your customer demand.

2020-07-08 16:54:00,Video,Other,"The COVID-19 pandemic, followed by the lockdown has surely left many of us introspecting on how blessed our lives are, and how much of it we may have taken for granted. It is obvious now more than ever that tomorrow is not promised, so the best attitude to have, is to live every day like it‚Äôs your last (even as you plan for the future).
----------
Speaking of the future, let us talk about Wills. A Will is a legal document that sets out who you want to receive your assets when you pass on. You can choose to write a simple Will or a comprehensive Will. 
----------
It is very important that you put a #Legacee in place as you write down your wishes in a Will. This ensures a seamless transfer of your assets to your loved ones and family disputes can be avoided. You also have peace of mind knowing that if anything happens to you, your beneficiaries are catered for with the assets you have stated in your Will which in many instances is only known to you and may be lost if you had not written it down in your Will. 
----------
Imagine the consequences of not putting a #Legacee in place and leaving things to chance - they could unfold in ways you do not want. So while you are staying safe, be sure to reach out to us via Legacee@stanbicibtc.com to get you started on putting a Legacee in place and avoid stories that touch. #WealthWednesday",1895.0,1737.0,1737.0,2.8,3.05,53.0,50.0,50.0,2.0,1.0

Savings is an essential part of finacial life. It helps for proper planning  and actualization of goals. 
  My husband and I has always saved individually not until there was need for us to save together. In 2020,  we needed to get a property for ourselves so started saving towards it, we both are into business so every week I pay in 10k into the account while my husband pays in 20k, we did this from 2020 with so many challenges, some days we go to market without making sales, some days we wake up cashless, some days we wake up  and notice that the kids are sick, all these challenges and more was what we faced, was it family calling to demand money for one or thing or the other? It was quite challenging but late 2023 we were able to save up and more, the property was acquired and here we're happy that we took that bold step. @stanbicibtc #lovewithstanbicibtc #itcanbe",1794.0,1586.0,1586.0,8.08,9.14,145.0,92.0,92.0,53.0,0.0

Stanbic IBTC and NFF put pen to paper on a N2.3 billion annual partnership deal 

Stanbic IBTC Holdings PLC, a member of Standard Bank Group, has partnered with the Nigerian Football Federation (NFF) to further develop football in Nigeria. The signed MoU between Stanbic IBTC and NFF is slated to be effective from 2022.

Under the agreed terms, Stanbic IBTC will provide Group Life Insurance for all 35 players of the national team with a total sum assured of N1.75 Billion Naira and Total Personal Accident insurance for all 35 players with a total of N583,000,000 annually for the next 3 years. Stanbic IBTC will also provide gender sensitivity support for female sports correspondents in Nigeria.

Dr Demola Sogunle, Chief Executive, Stanbic IBTC Holdings PLC, spoke of the landmark agreement. ‚ÄúToday, you are all witnesses to a landmark event: the consummation of a partnership geared towards driving the growth of football in Nigeria. We are all gathered here to grace this momentous occasion as two great Nigerian institutions come together to advance Nigeria‚Äôs most popular sport. With this partnership, we will further drive the development of the youths via football.‚Äù

According to Sogunle, the partnership was based on youth empowerment and football development which he described as values shared by Stanbic IBTC and the Nigerian Football Federation.

On the partnership with Stanbic IBTC, Amaju Pinnick said: ‚ÄúThis has been a historic and one of the most unique sports contracts we have had in a long while and we are excited that Stanbic IBTC is driving not just a partnership with the NFF but a sponsorship that also encourages the advancement of the female gender.‚Äù

Bukola Olopade, Managing Director Nilayo Sports Management Limited, consultant to the partnership said, ‚ÄúThis agreement is the most unique we have signed so far because it directly benefits the players and also contributes to the advancement of the girl child.‚Äù

I really thank God for the gift of my darling wife, who supports and advice me during decision makings. I always call her my fourth eyes. I and wifey contributed immensely in a project of acquiring a property that we love so much, we saved towards that project until it became a reality. She knows how to manage and organize our home making it so easy for us not to spend unnecessarily.
I am so blessed to have someone like her as my wife.

Sometimes early last year, we we're asked to vacate our apartment because the owner of the house sold it, I had little money on me to rent another apartment , but then my wife called me and told me not to rent an apartment, instead we should move in with my mum for a little while then both of us will contribute money to build on our own empty land, wow üò≥üò≥ I never thought about that, we did just that, and under 3 months two rooms was ready that we can call our own, we moved in December and I'm so glad we we're able to achieve this because of our collective efforts of saving money together, we're still Saving money to complete the building

The first time I met Jeremy was when I tried out for an improv group in college. He thought I was the most annoying person he had ever met. Fast forward to a year later, and I finally won him over. We were friends for a few years in college, but the year he graduated we had a falling out. I didn't speak to Jeremy for about three years.

Then, one day after I moved to NYC, I was walking through Union Square and he ran up to me and knocked my hat off my head. He doesn't remember it that way, but that is how I remember it. I was like, 'Oh great. Here's that huge jerk.' So, we talked a little and parted ways. After that, we slowly started rebuilding our friendship. It was probably about a month or two later that Jeremy realized he had fallen in love with me. I wasn't having it, though. For six months (I think it was six months), he pursued me. He wasn't super aggressive, but he made it clear that he wanted to be with me. He didn't buy me flowers or gifts or anything. He was just always there. When I needed something, he was there. When I needed a person to talk to, he was there. When I needed help moving, he was there. When I needed someone to walk me home, he was there. Finally, just before New Year's Day of 2006, I realized that I wanted him to continue being there. Jeremy likes to say that the moment he fell in love with me was the moment he realized that he 'wanted to see me tomorrow.' He would wake up and think, 'I want to see Autumn today' or 'I hope I see Autumn tomorrow.' Once he realized that he was having that same thought every single day, he knew he was in it for real. Anyway, after I agreed to 'date' him. We went on, I think, one official 'date' and that was it. We were in it for the long haul. 11 years and one kid later, I regret nothing!""

""I met my significant other in church, where he was the guest speaker. I was new in that church myself, but the church musician, a friend, who had introduced me to the church, also introduced me to Grant before the service, saying, 'Grant, I want you to meet a special lady.' I was completely taken with him, both in our convo before the service and then while listening to his sermon. A month later, when he returned as guest speaker again, I sought him out during Fellowship after the service, and he said he'd like to get together to talk about writing. (I'm a freelance writer/editor.) I invited him over for dinner (don't remember now what I cooked), after dinner we had sex, and we never did get around to talking about writing. More dates followed. Twice he dumped me because we were getting too close and it made him nervous, and twice he dumped me when an old girlfriend of his came back into the picture, but I won out in the long run ‚Äî we've been living together for over a decade now.""

The day we married is one of the best days of my life, as on that day I found my¬†best friend¬†for life. It is true, I was skeptical in the beginning, but you made me feel so loved and comfortable, that I cannot imagine a life without you. Now, I genuinely feel I am the luckiest girl on earth, for I have a man who is loyal to me.
I want to confess that, every night after you drift away to sleep, I stay awake just to watch you sleep. You may think I am crazy, but I cannot help it, I am obsessed with you. I only want one thing in life now, to be your only¬†love forever.

How my hubby  has shown me ultimate love through @stanbicibtc savings .
....................
I met my loving , selfless husband, got married, we got pregnant and the time of delivery comes and we were  excited, hmmm it was a smooth labor at first until I was 6% dilated and I was about to be wheeled to the labour room, I was checked again, behold I was stocked at 6% for 10hours , hmmm the doctor told us the baby is weak and he could barely hear the heartbeat as the baby was stocked and stressed , I was scared , imagine the pain and and fear, oh God ,what are we going to do, I don't want to loose my baby,  The doctor called my husband and when he returned I could see the fear through him, he said babe please the only solution is CS , I said we didn't plan for this, he said don't worry, after few minutes we decided, and the operation was successful, my baby cord was rolled round her tummy 3times ,hence, the reason for her being stocked. How did you pay baby, I asked, he said ,you remember the money I said you should be saving in your Stanbic bank, it came to the rescue.Thank you Stanbic, Thank you love for everything.#LovewithStanbicIBTC #GoForLove #ItCanBe",732.0,675.0,675.0,2.05,2.22,15.0,14.0,14.0,1.0,0.0

This is how to grow the economy. Let all those who believe Nigeria is a huge market come invest in it. There are over 100 million cars in Nigeria, and counting. Why are the Tyre making companies not here? Dunlop, Michelin, Goodyear, Yokohama, Bridgestone... we need the jobs and let the expertise be transferred. Let them come here and set up businesses.

Broken screen

Stolen

Fallen into water

Damaged Camera

We never hope for a mishap to occur. Sadly,¬†¬†these things happen and you would have to replace your phone in the event that it gets damaged anyway.

Why bear the risk when you can pay a small premium to an insurance company in exchange for the peace of mind that the premium paid covers you in the event of a mishap?

Congenital amputation can be a devastating experience for both the parents and child. It comes with adjustments no one plans for and realities that can be hard to accept. Here are a few #thoughts we have on being there for a child who may need you:

1. Emotional support: Everyone does better when they know they are loved, especially children. This is the first and most important thing a child needs. 
2. Psychological support: It may be too much to cope with even as a parent or guardian, but you must remember to teach them to believe in their abilities, regardless of what has happened 
3. Physical support: Ensure to get them the right prosthesis for their age and the medical care they need ‚Äì dedicated physiotherapy usually helps. It is also important that you show them how to do things themselves.

Do you know that you can only have one Retirement Savings Account (RSA)? Once you have opened an #RSA, you are required to maintain only that account. 
If for some reason, you have opened two or more Retirement Savings accounts previously, the law presumes that the first account opened is the valid account and invalidates all subsequent accounts opened. 
When you change jobs, simply provide your new employer with your existing RSA PIN to continue making your pension payments into your existing account. 
If you currently have multiple retirement savings accounts, please speak with your PFA today to find out the procedure for resolving the multiple accounts.

But have you ever wondered how the funds in your pension account are being managed? We think it‚Äôs important to know, so, we will be providing some insight to that.

#PenCom has provided an investment guideline and this guides PFAs as regards asset classes and exposure PFAs can have to these different Asset Classes.

Presently, contributions from all RSA holders who are not yet retired (irrespective of their age and risk criteria) are invested together as one pool called the RSA Active Fund.

However, beginning from 1 July, 2018, the RSA Active Fund will be split into three funds with different investment criteria. This new structure gives you, the contributor, a choice to opt for more risk/returns by switching between funds where eligible.

The first pool of funds (Fund 1) will have a higher exposure to the equities market (and other assets with varying returns) than all other funds. This is available to RSA holders who are less than 50 years old from commencement of this multi-fund structure.

Fund 2 will be the default fund for all RSA holders who are less than 50 years old as at 1 July, 2018. This fund has a medium exposure to the equities market.

Fund 3 will be the default fund for all RSA holders who are above 50 years as at 1 July, 2018 but are yet to retire. This is a conservative fund with a low exposure to the equities market.

However, the RSA Retirees fund which currently exists and caters to all retirees currently receiving pension will remain as it is and will be called Fund 4.

2017-05-24 14:03:00,Carousel,Other,"Work out how much to save each week or month and how long it would take you to reach that goal. 
Be more deliberate and choose an investment plan over a regular savings plan. That way your money is put to work to earn you even more.

Next, automate it. Set up a standing order for the weekly or monthly deductions. This ensures you do not miss any payment.

If you're working towards a larger goal, you may want to break it down into smaller milestones. Nothing is too small to save. 
You could even keep your small change in a ‚Äò‚Äôkolo‚Äò‚Äô until it's up to N5,000 and can then be invested in a mutual fund. 
Review your goal & current financial position frequently. As your income changes, you can adjust your contributions.

Remember to reward yourself! A few extra pieces of meat never hurt anyone. üòÄ reaching your financial goal is worth celebrating.

______

Test your knowledge with this #WealthWednesday trivia. ‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
Zaynab had a balance of N4,850,000 in her pension account at the time she passed away. What do you think will happen to this balance? 
Options below, please reply with your answer or quote. 
1.  It is paid to the next of kin stated in the records she has with her chosen PFA

2.  Once the PFA becomes aware of her demise, it will be transferred to her bank account by word of mouth

3. ¬†Her PFA gets to keep the money, even when they are aware that the account holder has died

4.  The funds are paid to the beneficiaries stated on her will or letter of administration. 
________

According to the pension reform act, when a pension account holder passes on, the funds in their account goes to the beneficiary recognized by law. ‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
This means that the funds can only be paid to the named beneficiary in a Will.¬† In the absence of a Will, the funds can then be released to the person who obtains and is named in the letter of Administration. ‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢

To ensure that your funds are paid to your intended beneficiary (ies) and save them the rigors of getting a letter of administration, we advise that you put a Will in place. See how¬†https://twitter.com/StanbicIBTC/status/1057619556171218944

2018-06-27 13:22:00,Carousel,Other,"Technology is doing so much for us but it does have drawbacks. For instance, more young people are seeking medical advice for neck and backache due to the excessive use of mobile devices. 
In fact, experts have verified that amongst young people aged between 16 and 34 years, there is a 60 per cent increase in those suffering from ‚Äútech-neck‚Äù. This unnatural posture strains muscles in the neck and chest area and if left unaddressed can increase the risk of pinched nerves, bone spurs and degenerative disk disease. It can also lead to you having a Hunchback. 
The good news is that by being aware of it and taking a few corrective actions, we can minimize and correct the negative (and unattractive) impacts of tech neck. 
How to test for Tech Neck:

The best way to know is to physically see what your spine, shoulder and neck are doing right now. 
Do you have Tech Neck?

If you find yourself looking down more at your smart phone than you did in the past, please review your current posture. Your device viewing position may feel comfortable and completely natural but it doesn‚Äôt mean your posture is great. 
What can one do to prevent Tech Neck?

________________________
Why is travel insurance necessary? Well, It is designed to provide financial protection for unexpected events during one‚Äôs trip.

Wondering if and why you need travel insurance? Here are a few benefits to consider;
‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ The insurer will provide the individual with dental assistance required abroad.
‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ The insurer will pay the cost of hospitalization, surgery, medical fees and pharmaceutical products, prescribed by the attending doctor.
‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ Should the insured be hospitalized due to sudden illness or accident for more than 10 days, the insurer will meet the cost of repatriating one immediate family member accompanying the insured at the time of the event to his usual place of residence.
‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ The insurer will be responsible for transferring the individual to a properly equipped health centre and repatriating the insured to his/her usual country of residence.
‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ Where insured‚Äôs trip is interrupted by the death of a close relative (as defined by the policy) ,the insurer will cover travel costs whenever the insured is unable to personally cover such trips.
‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ In the event of the death of the insured, the insurance company will necessary arrangements for the return of the insured‚Äôs remains to the insured‚Äôs country of citizenship. #WealthWednesday

There is a difference between ‚ÄúMaking money‚Äù and ‚Äúcreating wealth‚Äù. Are you making yourself wealthy or just earning an income?

Have you ever wondered how some sports stars become broke despite making millions during their careers?

Good question. It‚Äôs because wealth is not measured by the amount of money that comes into one‚Äôs pocket, it is measured by the amount that stays there.

Building your wealth requires some self-discipline and deliberate actions.  You need to save and invest to create wealth. Those are the actions required. üòâ

The main idea behind investing is to put money you‚Äôve saved into things you think will go up or at least maintain value over time. What kind of things? You may be asking.

Things like stocks, bonds and real estate. The trick is to buy an asset when the price is low, then try to sell when the price is high. That‚Äôs how you make a profit.

This can be done either on your own or through a professional financial adviser who would invest on your behalf and give you steady income on your investment.

Do you need help figuring out what investments would work best for you to create your desired wealth? We could walk you through our mutual funds, we have several of them.

Why not contact us and let us help you build your wealth? Kindly call 01 280 1266 or email¬†assetmanagement@stanbicibtc.com¬†for more details.",3297.0,2.0,2.0,4.06,6700.0,134.0,126.0,126.0,2.0,6.0

Or if you find yourself spending on certain things too often those cinema tickets, shopping spree or the usual turn up on Fridays, you could also consider this as a sign that you should be saving more.

Now, let‚Äôs create a scenario: How about you forego some of those extra expenses and commit those funds as an additional contribution towards your pension?¬† We call these voluntary contributions. üòâ

Imagine the amount you would have accrued at retirement if you make this slight adjustment for a couple of years! ü§î 
Now it gets interesting, remember pension funds are deducted at source & these deductions are done before taxes. Your voluntary contributions are also treated as such, thus helping you to legitimately save on taxes as you save more towards retirement.

Your voluntary contributions are also invested like the funds in your retirement savings account, which means your total contributions continue to grow thus accomplishing something significantly bigger than the expenditure you had to forego.

That's the amazing power of voluntary contributions. All you need to do is make a deliberate decision to start today.

‚úÖ The first step is to assess where you are now. How well did you do with your 2017 goals? Are there areas to improve on? Are there areas where you did well and would like to build on?
. ‚úÖ Set SMART - Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic and Time bound goals.
. ‚úÖ Prioritize your debt. Make a list of your liabilities and expected outflows. You may want to pay some attention to reducing your liabilities.
. ‚úÖ Start an emergency fund with the goal of having the equivalent of about 3- 6 months‚Äô salary saved for the rainy day. Just have something saved!!!
. ‚úÖ Self Development is in! Looking to advance your career next year? Read books, take online courses that will help develop your skills. Develop that random skill of yours.

Holiday plans for next year? Decide early and start planning now! It‚Äôs easier to find deals and work out a good payment plan when you start early

2017-11-17 17:52:00,Photo,Other,"Hello everyone, we received some new updates from our pension regulator, about withdrawals from your Voluntary Contributions (VC).
.
.
Effective 1 December 2017, only 50% of the VC will be available for withdrawal (subject to tax on income earned) while the 50% balance shall be retained to augment the contributor‚Äôs retirement benefits at retirement. 
Also, withdrawals from VC can only be made once every 2 years, while subsequent withdrawals shall only be on the additional contributions made after the last withdrawal. .
.
For Exempted/Foreign Contributors; withdrawals shall only be once every 2 years. However, total withdrawal of all the funds is allowed subject to tax deduction on both the income earned and principal amount if the withdrawal is done less than 5 years from the date of contribution. .
.
In addition, Pension Fund Administrators (PFAs) & Pension Fund Custodians (PFCs) must report any single transaction of N5m and above to the EFCC.

If you are a return VC withdrawal applicant & would like to process one, please click the link in our bio? If you‚Äôre a first-time applicant, kindly submit your application at any Stanbic IBTC office closest to you. For more information, call 01 271 6000 or email pensionsolution@stanbicibtc.com -

Can you provide the missing word? ‚ÄúPrevention is better than___‚Äô‚Äô As your financial advisers, your health is just as important to us as your wealth. You need to be alive & well first! 
Most people rarely go for medical check-ups, they think they don‚Äôt need one since, they are not actually sick yet. 
However, a routine preventive exam can identify potential health problems early when they may be easier to treat. 
Don't think ‚Äòif it is not broken, don‚Äôt fix it‚Äô. This works for appliances but is a poor approach for your health. 
This is why doctors say not to wait until you are sick to get physicals done, especially for people 40 years old and older 
So, why do you need regular medical check-ups?
‚û¢  To aid the early detection of ailments and prevention of complications that could be detrimental or cause death. ‚û¢  To detect if you have high or low blood sugar, hepatitis B & high or low blood pressure etc.

To protect you, there's a clause in the terms of agreement that ensures your principal is guaranteed as long as you keep the investment for a minimum of 3 months. Unbelievable right? 
This means that, if for any reason, the equities market performance declines, we guarantee that your principal will not reduce. 
Just like buying stocks, the SIGIF is sold in units. This means you buy at the prevailing offer price from us and sell at the prevailing bid price to redeem your investment.

This means that you can enjoy capital appreciation as prices go up and still earn annual dividends on your investment. 
What's more,  you get all the perks of investing in other Stanbic IBTC mutual fund investments.

‚Ä¢
Trust funds accumulated over a lifetime are not divided amongst your beneficiaries after one passes on but are retained as one fund to accumulate more wealth. Funds will have provision for payment to members of the family as the need arises while preserving some funds to continue growing. ‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
Why is having a Private Trust necessary? Well, for one, it will help preserve your family wealth hence facilitate intergenerational wealth transfer according to your wishes. Other reasons you should consider a Private Trust are: (slide 3).

The best part is that you‚Äôve settled the school fees obligation for this term, but the inevitable bit is that another school term starts in about 4 months, yikes! 
_
_

So, what‚Äôs your strategy for paying school fees in such a way that this very important obligation doesn‚Äôt cause so much dent in your finances the next time around? 
How about opening a Stanbic IBTC Education fund (#SET) for your child for as low as N100,000? You could even include this in your Group Life Insurance to guarantee your child‚Äôs education should the worst occur. 
_
_

The best part about opening a #SET account is that you get to pay N100k for the account worth N125k (which is a whopping 20% discount enjoyed before September 30th), you also have an opportunity to win a N25K gift voucher which can be used to shop for another round of #BackToSchool items on DealDey.

Remember, quality education will help our children shoot for the stars and actualize their dreams. It really is the best gift for your child. So, be sure to #SET them up!

2018-09-19 16:29:00,Carousel,Other,"So, here are seven health tips to consider as the kids settle into school.

1. Get vaccinated.
- Children should get all vaccinations required especially if going to school for the first time. Make sure they're protected against common childhood diseases and illnesses.

2. Set bedtimes.
A healthy amount of sleep each night is needed to stay focused throughout the day. Consider making their bedtimes a little earlier each night for a week or two before school starts.

3. Teach good hygiene habits.
Ensure that their lunchbox is kept clean and hygienic. Teach them to wash their hands after using the restroom and before going to lunch or eating a snack.

4. Stock up on healthy foods.
Stock up on healthy foods like fruits, vegetables, whole-grain bread and lean protein like chicken. Avoid junk food. Good nutrition helps the child to focus and concentrate.

5. Manage school stress.
Back-to-school season is stressful for kids and parents alike.
Kids may have physical symptoms such as stomach aches and nausea from ""making themselves sick over the worry and anxiety.

6. Backpack Problems
Make sure the backpack has wide straps and a padded back reaching to waist region. Inappropriately used backpack can expose child to issues such as back pain.

7. Be aware of allergens
Children who suffer from allergies suffer as dust mites, mold, and other allergens may be present in the classroom.

For some kids, it means a runny nose, sneezing, coughing, and watery eyes, which can also trigger asthma or lead indirectly to sinus infections.

2018-05-23 15:43:00,Carousel,Other,"On May 17, the world celebrated World Hypertension Day. Today, as we focus on health, we thought to spend it educating us a little so we can live better. Health is Wealth, right?
So, what really is hypertension? Hypertension is a health condition in which blood pressure is persistently elevated putting undue stress on the heart, blood vessels and other organs.

In 9 of 10 cases, the cause of hypertension cannot be identified. However, certain factors such as ‚Äì Hereditary, Environmental, Lifestyle (weight, diet, alcohol, smoking, physical inactivity and medication) are considered contributory. 
It is often referred to as the ‚Äòsilent killer‚Äô because it can exist with no obvious symptoms. The only way to detect it is by monitoring your blood pressure.

Blood pressure is not a fixed number. It varies with physical activity, excitement, time of day or night, and with emotional factors. This is why it is important to have your blood pressure taken under proper conditions and regularly. 
The higher the blood pressure, the greater the cardiovascular risk. The longer the duration of hypertension, the greater the cardiovascular risk.

No one's blood pressure is constant. Exercise or even a sudden burst of anger can raise our blood pressure readings, although not to dangerous levels or for long periods of time.
Secondly, it is a killer. People who have hypertension that is not treated are much more likely to die from or be disabled by complications such as strokes, heart attacks, heart failure, heart rhythm irregularities, and kidney failure than people who have normal blood pressure. 
Is hypertension treatable? It can be successfully managed but is not curable so what can you do to better manage your health? -	Be aware of your family‚Äôs medical history so you know if you are at risk. Always allow your BP to be taken whenever you are in the hospital and know and track your numbers. -	If you are at risk, please see a doctor and get treatment quickly. It‚Äôs always advisable to begin with healthy lifestyle changes.

You may also choose to accumulate assets as early as you can afford them. 
An asset is something that has value. This meaning slightly differs in Accounting, which describes an asset as a resource with economic value that an individual, corporation or country owns or controls with the expectation that it will provide future benefit.
-
-
This simply means that anything you buy that makes you more money either by its use, or by selling it afterwards, is an asset.
-
-
So the next time you are faced with the financial decision of getting an asset, do keep in mind the value that can be derived from it.

Autism and autism¬†spectrum disorder (ASD) are both general terms for a group of complex disorders of brain development, characterized, in varying degrees, by difficulties in social interaction, verbal and nonverbal communication and repetitive behaviours.

Autism is a complex neurobehavioral condition that includes impairments in social interaction, developmental language and communication skills combined with rigid, repetitive behaviours. 
Autism¬†spectrum disorder¬†can¬†often be difficult to diagnose. At present, there's no official¬†test¬†for diagnosing¬†autism.

Most children affected by the disorder do not have intellectual disabilities, some study finds, and even among the severely low-functioning, about 10% may improve dramatically over time, with some growing out of their diagnosis by their teens.

So here are some strategies for promoting language development in nonverbal children and adolescents with autism.",2581.0,1.0,1.0,3.33,8600.0,86.0,83.0,83.0,0.0,3.0

The session ended on a very exciting note for the students, teachers, and other participants, who were all enlightened on the intricacies of financial management.
As a way of also contributing to environmental protection, the programme was concluded with a tree-planting session by the officials of Stanbic, JAN volunteers and Members of the School Management.
Special thanks to JAN for this opportunity to impact the younger generation.

How does a mutual fund work? It involves collection of money from various retail investors and then buying wholesale investments on their behalf and sharing the returns amongst the participants in line with their investment amounts.

Remember how Mumsy used to collabo with a group of friends to buy foodstuffs from the market in bulk, and then they‚Äôd split amongst themselves to save cost and get better quality foodstuff? This works similarly. .

Just like a banker will offer a better rate to a depositor with N5,000,000 than to one with N100,000. Mutual funds remind us that we can come together so that our N100,000 earns like returns with the N5,000,000. .
.
Everyone brings what they have, N5,000, N10,000, N1m and the money together forms a pool of cash that can be invested. These funds are then managed by a Fund Manager like Stanbic IBTC Asset management who makes all the investment decisions.
.
.
One of the benefits you get is having access to returns from the total amount in the fund alongside all the other investors. So all you do is put your money in, and watch it grow as you earn returns on your investment. .
.
Mutual funds are also open-ended, that means you do not have to wait till a specific time to get your money out. Also, your investment is liquid (easily converted to cash) at any time you need it. Sounds good right? .
.
And with access to an online platform similar to your internet banking, you can keep an eye on your funds, make additional investments, partial or full withdrawals and even switch between different fund types at any time. .
.

So this #WealthWednesday, we‚Äôll be talking about the second best part ‚Äì giving and receiving gifts üéÅ
Don‚Äôt get us wrong, the gifts are great. But the best part of it all is the thought that comes with the gift ‚Äì the intent to make someone feel special.
.
.
While all gifts are valuable, it‚Äôs always a good idea to take the most care of those really obviously expensive gifts üöóüè°
One way is by being very careful with them. Another is keeping them safe. Allow us to recommend a third option ‚Äì insuring them. .
.
Did you know that jewellery and other expensive items aren‚Äôt automatically covered under a homeowner‚Äôs policy?
So, in the off-chance that you experience a loss of said items from your home, and the cause of the loss is not specifically mentioned in your policy, you may not be covered and compensated üòØüò¶ .
.
That‚Äôs why we are here: to help protect your most valued possessions ‚Äì especially those received from the one who loves you. üòç 
So, if you receive really expensive gifts this Valentine‚Äôs Day, let‚Äôs make them priceless by protecting not just the gift, but the memories with an insurance policy.
.

Let‚Äôs help you insure the memories of this special day. Call 01-2770394 or email us via insurancesolution@stanbicibtc.com today. #ValentinesDay #Love #Insurance #StanbicIBTC",1763.0,1.0,1.0,3.63,6400.0,64.0,64.0,64.0,0.0,0.0

Which is why you should start today as your savings will grow over time till retirement.

Nigeria‚Äôs contributory pension scheme is one of the tax efficient ways of saving as your contributions are deducted before tax is applied on your salary.

To be honest there‚Äôs nothing worse than being unable to work because of old age only to realize that you have not saved. 
Think about it, when you are younger, your whole life is ahead of you and you have something older people would love to reclaim - time.

Writing a will is you being proactive about the certainties of life and ensuring that you are not taken unawares.

You don‚Äôt have to wait until you are old and retired. You can get started in the prime of life. 
You don‚Äôt have to be rich too. Your RSA and bank account balances are assets that you can cover in your legacee.

Now is the time to shape the future of those you love. You can write a story today that will be read in your own words tomorrow.

Your legacee today can make a difference. Even in your final moments, you will be assured that you made your mark.

Retirement is an important milestone and every now and then, we celebrate a retirement, for a parent or a close relative.

We know you get worried about how they will fare now that they are retired. Will they get their money? When? All valid concerns.

If your parents are due to retire soon, you will want to know what will happen next. Today, we‚Äôll tell you about annuities.

With pensions, an annuity is a guaranteed, regular payment that removes the risk of retirees running out of #money.

An annuity guarantees that the retiree gets a payment from the PFA on a monthly, quarterly, bi annual or annual basis.

With the annuity option, one gets a lump sum payment with the rest of the retirement savings sent to an insurance company.  Only approved insurance companies can offer annuity products & the investment of annuity funds is supervised by @PenComNig 
Stanbic IBTC Insurance Brokers will provide quotes on annuity from different insurance companies so retirees have a choice. 
Our insurance brokers also ensure that the retirees‚Äô beneficiaries get the necessary benefits in the event of death. #WealthWednesday #Retirement #Pension #Annuity",1591.0,1.0,1.0,5.22,8300.0,83.0,83.0,83.0,0.0,0.0

2017-05-31 17:14:00,Carousel,Other,"Hey guys! Back to the hustle from the long weekend! 
For today‚Äôs #WealthWednesday we will be discussing the importance of sleep. I mean, sleep is essential to your health.

Sleep is a basic necessity of life. It is as important as air, food and water. It determines if we wake up feeling refreshed, alert and ready for the day. 
Sleep is important because it also determines if our jobs, relationships, productivity, health and safety will suffer.

So let‚Äôs do a little Sleep Diagnosis. How do you sleep? 
If you said yes to one or more of the above listed symptoms, you just may be sleep deficient. Sleep deprivation  does have long term negative effects. 
Although sleep experts generally recommend an average of 7-9 hours per night, some people can get along with less while others need as much as 10 hours to feel alert the next day. 
Let‚Äôs look up a few sleep myths. 
1. You can ""cheat"" on the amount of sleep you get.
Sleep experts say most adults need between 7-9 hours of sleep each night for optimum performance, health and safety. 
When we don't get adequate sleep, we accumulate a sleep debt that can be difficult to ""pay back"" if it becomes too big. 
2. Snoring is a common problem, especially among men, but it isn‚Äôt harmful. #Rest #TakeABreak #HealthIsWealth",1717.0,1.0,1.0,4.43,7600.0,76.0,76.0,76.0,0.0,0.0

Credit alerts definitely give everyone joy. They are major #APPyness triggers because spending money is so much fun. Oh the clothes, shoes and food you can buy.

Some studies show that young people appear focused on having fun and living life to the fullest today. YOLO, right?  Infact, 81% would rather spend on travel than save & have half what our parents did at the same age http://for.tn/2rcQkbz 
However, saving & investing can ultimately result in even more fun. Sowing the seeds for financial independence can also be fun.

How?
Exercise regularly: Be involved in any activity that raises your heart rate and relaxes your mind and body. 30 minutes of daily heart-pounding activity is recommended.

Laugh: Don‚Äôt take yourself too seriously. Try to find joy in everything.

Eat healthy and regularly: Eating small but frequent meals can help your body maintain an even level of blood sugar, keep your energy up, stay focused, and avoid mood swings.

Sleep well: Rest is a key factor in coping with workplace stress. Sleep for 6-8 hours every 24 hours.

Don‚Äôt get angry: Do not go beyond consternation into fury or rage. Anger brings on stress too.

Get a massage: A proper massage can help ease tense muscles and relieve pain and discomfort.

Drink water: Lots of water. You should aim to drink 6-8 glasses of water a day. #WealthWednesday #StanbicIBTC",1163.0,1.0,1.0,2.84,3300.0,33.0,33.0,33.0,0.0,0.0

Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease that usually affects the lungs.  Compared with other diseases caused by a single infectious agent, TB is the second biggest killer globally and it remains a serious health challenge in developing countries including Nigeria.

TB is spread through the air from one person to another. The TB germs are passed through the air when a person who is infected with the disease coughs, laughs, sings, or sneezes. Though highly contagious, but it is not easy to catch.

The chances of spreading TB to someone you live or work with are much higher than to a stranger so, here are some ways to stop the spread of tuberculosis. #WealthWednesday",3509.0,0.0,0.0,3.62,,127.0,121.0,121.0,1.0,5.0

________________________
Why is travel insurance necessary? Well, It is designed to provide financial protection for unexpected events during one‚Äôs trip.

Wondering if and why you need travel insurance? Here are a few benefits to consider;
‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ The insurer will provide the individual with dental assistance required abroad.
‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ The insurer will pay the cost of hospitalization, surgery, medical fees and pharmaceutical products, prescribed by the attending doctor.
‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ Should the insured be hospitalized due to sudden illness or accident for more than 10 days, the insurer will meet the cost of repatriating one immediate family member accompanying the insured at the time of the event to his usual place of residence.
‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ The insurer will be responsible for transferring the individual to a properly equipped health centre and repatriating the insured to his/her usual country of residence.
‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ Where insured‚Äôs trip is interrupted by the death of a close relative (as defined by the policy) ,the insurer will cover travel costs whenever the insured is unable to personally cover such trips.
‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ In the event of the death of the insured, the insurance company will necessary arrangements for the return of the insured‚Äôs remains to the insured‚Äôs country of citizenship.  However, travel insurance is not eligible for the following categories;

Individual intending to travel more than 92 consecutive days

Persons of less than 3 months age

Persons aged from 81 years old

Non-residents in the country where the insurance is issued. 
Let‚Äôs help you facilitate your travel insurance needs so you won‚Äôt have to pay out-of-pocket for unforeseen medical and such other expenses. call us on 01-2770394

2018-04-25 16:44:00,Carousel,Other,"Hi guys, it‚Äôs another edition of our #WealthWednesday series today, so we decided to share some useful insurance related tips. ‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
First your car: Did you know that your car‚Äôs insurance status can be confirmed online? 
Copy and paste this in browser üëâ bit.ly/2HqvVs1

In the event that your car isn‚Äôt insured and the comprehensive policy is looking very pricey ‚Äì you have an option: ‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
Third Party Insurance. A Third party insurance policy does not provide any benefit to you (the insured) but it covers your legal liability for death/disability of third-party (the other party) loss or damage to the third party property. Ask us how we can help. ‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
Remember this: Your insurer is liable for the repair of the third party‚Äôs car since you can also make a claim where you are responsible for the damage. ‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
Group Life Insurance: If you're an employee in a firm with up to 3 staff, it's also compulsory to have a group life insurance policy in place. This ensures a pay out of up to 3 times your annual emolument in the event of death. So, ask your employer about it. ‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
Health Insurance: It is advisable for your employer to have a Health Insurance package in place for employees. This ensures that your medical expenses are covered in the case of ill health and helps you avoid out of pocket medical expenses.

Seriously guys, you really can and should insure anything you consider valuable; phones, tablets, laptops‚Ä¶ you name it! Then you can make a claim if these valuables get stolen or damaged. ‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢

Today, our #WealthWednesday will be focusing on Women‚Äôs Health.üòâ Women and men share many similar health problems, but women also have their own health issues, which deserve special consideration and it is also helpful that men understand and are supportive of the health concerns of the women. .
.
A few women specific health issues are- breast cancer, cervical cancer, and bone density screenings. Issues unique to women include pregnancy, menopause, and conditions of the female organs. .
.
Some diseases occur at a higher frequency in women. Gallstones are three to four times more common in women than in men as are migraine headaches at a ratio of three females to one male. Also, the effects of sexually transmitted diseases can be more serious in women. .
.

The biggest threats to women's health are often preventable. Here's what you need to know to live a longer, healthier life.

1. Follow a Heart-Healthy Diet

2. Exercise Every Day

3. Visit Your Doctor

4. Cut Down Your stress

5. Create Healthy Habits

Do you know your employer should remit your pension payments no later than seven (7) days after your salary is paid? .

Beyond the fact that making pension contributions is compulsory in Nigeria, these contributions serve as a great place to start planning towards that retirement you deserve. .

The best advice is to become more deliberate about contributing towards your pension. So here are a few tips on how to make this happen. .
.
Monitor your account: There are several easy options to help you monitor the inflows into your pension account. Monitoring helps you determine if the contributions into your account are consistent and adequate to fund the retirement you dream of.

Have a plan and write it down so you can work towards your goal. Here‚Äôs the link to our pension calculator to help you forecast and plan right: bit.ly/2sIQGIC
.
. 
Take action: Using your plan, will your current monthly payment be sufficient to fund your retirement? If not, you may need to augment the amount your employer remits by making additional voluntary contributions. .
.

There are several reasons to save for retirement. Do you agree that an important reason is to do so for the rainy day?

Amongst other reasons, the idea of having a retirement saving is to ensure an income is guaranteed at retirement.

At a younger age you are still strong to work hard enough to earn a reasonable income through your salary or business.

Don‚Äôt spend it all. The smart thing to do is to set aside some funds towards your retirement.

Committing a portion of your income over a period of time (systematic saving and investing) has significant benefits. #WealthWednesday",1254.0,0.0,0.0,5.74,,72.0,68.0,68.0,0.0,4.0

Here it goes: A lady went to complain at a bank about withdrawals from her recently deceased husband‚Äôs account. She had received several alerts & discovered all the monies had been withdrawn. Not by her! The bank officials ran their checks and the cameras showed that her husband had made the withdrawals. 
She was quite shocked but she produced a death certificate confirming her husband‚Äôs demise prior to said dates.

When looking to create wealth, the aim is to put money you‚Äôve saved into investments you expect to appreciate over time.

Instruments like stocks, bonds and real estate are useful investment tools. The goal is to sell your investment at a higher price than the purchase price in order to make a profit.

This can be done on your own, through a licensed professional or a financial institution.

However, the very first step is a desire to be financially independent and the willingness to do what it takes.

Earning an income is great ‚Ä¶ it pays the bills ‚Ä¶ keeps body and soul together, but typically, that‚Äôs money that goes into your pocket and right back out.

a.  Investing in equities

b.  Investing in a side hustle

c.  Going back to school

d.  Cutting costs

If you picked (a.) to invest in equities listed on the stock exchange, this thread is for you.

You may have heard that stock prices are very low right now and gotten discouraged. But what if we told you that now is the best time to buy?

In retail, the best time to restock is when you can buy at low prices right? It‚Äôs the same with the stock market - buy low, sell high.

Yes, the economy is at a slow point but this phase will pass and transition into growth. The stock market will get even more vibrant.

We also believe that new products like Exchange Traded Funds and new company listings in many sectors will help drive the market up.

So, what happens when you open a Stockbroking account, invest and the company declares that shareholders will get dividends? 
If you already own stocks in any company (perhaps we set up your investment portfolio), you could get your dividends automatically without going to a bank.#MoneyGist",1247.0,0.0,0.0,2.81,,35.0,35.0,35.0,0.0,0.0

Having children is a great responsibility and privilege. For many parents, it is also the start of an uncharted journey.

As a parent, do you sometimes look at your child and imagine them as successful adults? A lot of us believe that quality education is a great start to achieving this dream. It‚Äôs a gift that keeps giving.

However, quality education will not just happen. We can‚Äôt leave it to chance or wishful thinking, we have to plan. How can you plan? Consider starting an education trust for the little one, it‚Äôs a great start.

With a trust, a person (a trustee) holds on to something as its nominal owner for the good of one or more beneficiaries. 
The Stanbic IBTC Educational Trust (SET) is flexible & has long term benefits providing sound education for the children.

Spouse Annuity ‚Äì This policy provides cover for your spouse up to 50%, 75% and 100% of your pension. When the retiree dies, the spouse automatically becomes the annuitant and gets the payments for the rest of their life.

Increasing Annuity ‚Äì This plan allows for an increase in the annuity amount at each policy anniversary. The standard increase offered is usually 5% or 7.5% each year on a compounding basis.

Like if you agree üëá ‚Äò‚ÄôHealth is like money, we never have an idea of its value until we lose it‚Äô‚Äô- Josh Billings

Have you been in a situation where you or your loved one needed medical attention but could not gain access because you were broke? So broke that you couldn‚Äôt even afford ‚ÄúTfare‚Äù to get you to the hospital. üòî

The sad reality is, days like this exist and they happen too often. You have to plan ahead. This is where a health insurance plan becomes very useful.üòâ What is health insurance sef? 
Health insurance provides coverage that pays for medical expenses incurred by you, the insured. 
Subscribing to a health insurance scheme is like making a down payment to enjoy immense benefits that outweigh the costs.
The insured might choose to pay out of her own pocket and then get reimbursed for the expense incurred.

Alternatively, the insurer can make payments directly to the healthcare provider.
A health insurance policy lets you use a particular hospital or a curated list of hospitals anytime the need arises without thinking about how much you need to pay.

The health insurance covers In-patient and Outpatient benefits including the following üëÜ #WealthWednesday #StanbicIBTC  #Insurance #HealthIsWealth",1536.0,0.0,0.0,3.97,,61.0,60.0,60.0,0.0,1.0

Create a balanced schedule: Analyze your schedule, responsibilities, and daily tasks. Try to find a balance between work and family life and social activity.

Distinguish between the ‚Äòshoulds‚Äô and the ‚Äòmusts‚Äô: Sort out the urgent and important from the nice to haves. Don‚Äôt overload yourself.

Plan regular breaks: Deliberately take short breaks throughout the day to take a walk or sit back and clear your mind. Stepping away from work to briefly relax and recharge will improve productivity.

Take a holiday: We mean a real holiday where you relax and can be adventurous- not just a shopping holiday.

Know your body: Your body speaks. Listen to it and seek medical advice when you feel unwell. 
Be deliberate about planning rest and recreation into your schedule. It will restore your creativity, fuel your vision, and bring balance to your world. #StanbicIBTC #WealthWednesday",1094.0,0.0,0.0,3.38,,37.0,37.0,37.0,0.0,0.0

What is stress? It is a State of tension that arises when you experience demands from your environment or from inside yourself.

Stress sometimes comes during life-changes aka #adulting: Moving from Childhood to Adolescence to being a young adult. Getting to middle age, marriage, becoming a parent and aging are also stressful periods.
